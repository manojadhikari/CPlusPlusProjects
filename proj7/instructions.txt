You will have 2 weeks to complete this project.

First, you should work on implementing the sequence class, but using a linked list as the underlying data structure. Before starting on the sequence class, however, you will need to implement the list_piece function in the node class.

Second, you must complete the other linked list toolkit functions in the node class that currently have implementations.

You will need to download the following files to complete the lab:

node.h - The interface for the node class used to build linked lists.
node.cpp - The implementation of the node class, minus the additional toolkit functions that you must implement.
sequence.h - The interface for the sequence class for which you must write the implementation.
Your final submission should include all of the above files, with your implementation of the incomplete toolkit functions in node.cpp, as well as a sequence.cpp file with your linked list implementation of the sequence class.
