This week you will be changing and adding to classes that you wrote in earlier weeks. First, you will modify the polynomial class from week 4 to use a dynamic area with no size limit. Second, you will add 8 functions to your string class. These functions are described in textbook problem 1 at the end of chapter 4, as well as in the comments at the top of the header file below.

The following .cpp files are fully functional implementations of the polynomial and string classes. You should download these and modify them rather than using your solutions from earlier labs:

poly.cpp
mystring.cpp

The following .h files contain updated declarations of the classes you need to change and descriptions in the headers. Please remove the "-1" from the file names before using.

poly.h
mystring.h
